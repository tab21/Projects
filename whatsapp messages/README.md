# Twilio WhatsApp messaging

It helps sending messages from our active number from Twilio to the WhatsApp numbers. Since mine is trial account I can only send the messages to the verified numbers but it should work same for others as well.

## Build with

- Nodejs

  - Packages used : twilio

- Javascript

## Challenges faced

There was just one challenge when making it that the index files read the environment variable.

## What I learnt

I learnt that the environment variable are actually stored in the environment and not the .env file. I think people keep those as backup since after exporting to the environment variables to the environment my application was working.But i also kept them as backup. Thus, I learned to export / set the environment variables.
